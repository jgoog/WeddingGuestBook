In this project I applied REST API for a Wedding GuestBook  application, which allows users to see who is was at the wedding, some fun things that they can talk to other guest about, and post pictures from the wedding. The user will have to create an account with an email to use this app. The user can update their post or delete a picture or comment they have left.
